# VirusModel
Thought excercise in modelling Covid-19 . You can experiment with it at https://jsfiddle.net/jaundice/d4wp6u9k/9/

I'm not a medical professional, but I thought it would be interesting to model interactions between members of a population through home, work, social and other activities over time and how a virus might be transmitted through the population in different senarios.
