## VirusModel
Thought excercise in modelling Covid-19 . You can experiment with it at https://jsfiddle.net/jaundice/d4wp6u9k/9/

I'm not a medical professional, but I thought it would be interesting to model interactions between members of a population through home, work, social and other activities over time and how a virus might be transmitted through the population in different senarios. 

I am now trying to enhance the first version with changes over time with policy and behaviour and impact on / from health service

## Working knowledge


# current knowledge: 
* probably 80% of infections go unregistered

From skynews interview with ICU doctor
* 10% hospitalised
* 4% ICU
* 2% Dead


* 50% registered cases > 65yo
* young children mostly asymptomatic

* median 5.1 day incubation, 97.5% within 11.5 days.  max up to 2 weeks https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported

* virus is most contagious before symptoms show and in the first 7 days of symptoms https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms 

# underlying health conditions breakdown 
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/the-uk-new-coronavirus-measures-in-numbers 
* Heart Disease 7.4m
* Asthma 5.4m / 200K very severe
* Autoimmune disorders 4m
* Diabetes 3.9m
* Cancer 2.9m ? (from data some will have recovered still at risk?)


# Health Service breakdown
Front line doctors / nurses / beds / ICU, PPE availability



# Key Delivery workers breakdown
Medical supplies, food etc


# Key Retail workers breakdown
Supermarkets, food, pharmacy


# Policy
* self isolation 
* social distancing
* lockdown 
* medic isolation
* ...


# Things to model:

* population age?
* underlying population health
* population contact
* health service utilization - doctors / beds / professional's health
* health outcome
* policy changes - social distancing, total lockdown, healthcare professional isolation, key worker childcare
* public adherance to policy
* supply chain of critical items?
* changes in contagion as individual disease cases progress
